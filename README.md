## 👀 What is this?

This is a mobile-first approach app. When it is finished, you will be able to create your own account and add the birthdays of your family and friends, so you don't forget any of them again!

The app will have a calendar view and a detail view so you can edit the data of each birthday and add notes. There will also be a birthday reminder service from the backend. Enjoy it! 🥳

## 🤝 Partnership

The backend of this app is being provided by my partner [Marrarichy Da Silva](https://github.com/scatt89).
We have planned together the API contract and the features of the app.

## 💪 Challenges

This is the first time for me that I create an app with the whole **authentication process**, including register, login, forget password, different routes and services to change birthday data in calendar, account settings, delete account, etc.

Just as my app is going to have many features, I am also planning a complete frontend development, including **tests**. It will be my first time integrating tests in a large development.

Also I am doing this work in collaboration with my partner Marrarichy, which requieres of precise **teamwork**.
